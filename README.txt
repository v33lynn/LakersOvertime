Gameday page project:


Your goal is to build the ultimate post-game experience page for fans. 

Attached you will find assets you can use to help build out your page. 

There are photos, logos and advertisements, along with links to video highlight embed, box scores, and recaps for you to use at your discretion.


The only thing strictly required for the project is to make sure both advertisements are placed on the page. 

The rest is up to you to determine which content from the game is the most relevant and useful for the fans. 



You will be evaluated based on your code structure and these user experience concepts: organization, layout, responsiveness, and design.



Please let me know if you have any questions and submit your completed project by 1pm on Friday, July 22.
