sample site I created to mimick a pseudo website for Lakers digital content integration called "Lakers Overtime" 
integrated sponsored marketing, stats, fully functioning links and carousel photo gallery embed

To See the Website:
1.) click "Clone or download" 
2.) right click "index.html" and select "open with ___your browser__"

*as long as all files are in one place, opening index.html file should load everything.
